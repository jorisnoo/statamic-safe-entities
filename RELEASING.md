# Releasing

Release from `main` using an explicit version without a `v` prefix. `CHANGELOG.md` is the source of truth for GitHub release notes. The repo-local Python helper requires Python 3.9+, Git, and the project’s existing build/test tools; Shipmark is no longer used.

## Prepare

1. Review changes since the last release and choose the version from compatibility: patch for fixes, minor for compatible additions, major for breaking changes. For a pre-1.0 package, describe incompatible changes explicitly and normally bump the minor version. Do not infer the bump solely from commit prefixes.
2. Add a curated entry at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`: `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`. Use only relevant sections such as Added, Changed, Fixed, and Breaking. Explain user-visible behavior and migrations; combine related commits and omit routine dependency/CI noise. Preserve all historical entries. Use `X.Y.Z` everywhere, including release links.
3. Update the version files and build outputs described below. Run the relevant checks, review the complete diff, and commit only the intended release changes (normally `release: X.Y.Z`). Respect configured Git commit signing. Never include unrelated local work.

Configured release checks:

```sh
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

Install the project’s normal dependencies first. The helper runs these checks when publishing; dry-run prints them without executing them. Run any additional checks needed for the changed behavior before committing.

## Release

From the repository root, replace `X.Y.Z` with the chosen version:

```sh
python3 scripts/release.py X.Y.Z --dry-run
python3 scripts/release.py X.Y.Z
```

The helper requires the configured release branch, a clean working tree, a unique nonempty changelog entry, matching version files, a newer version than reachable local release tags, and an unpublished remote tag. Fetch origin and its tags before preparing a release so the local history is current. Dry-run reads remote refs but does not modify files, run checks, tag, or push.

Publishing runs the configured checks, creates a signed annotated tag, and atomically pushes the branch and that specific tag to origin. It never generates changelog text, edits version files, stages files, commits, or pushes other tags. `.release.json` holds the branch, checks, version files and signing policy. A signing failure is an error; configure the agent’s signing access rather than silently disabling signing.

The tag workflow validates the same changelog entry and publishes it with the exact version as the release title. It uses `--verify-tag` and links to the changelog at the released commit. Only this workflow creates the GitHub release. Package prereleases such as `1.2.3-beta.1` are marked prerelease and do not become Latest.

Verify the workflow and published release/assets before reporting success. If a push fails after local tagging, the helper can reuse that tag only while it still points to the same HEAD and is unpublished remotely. For runner or secret failures, fix the configuration and rerun the workflow. For a problem in the tagged source, prepare a corrected new version. Never move, delete, or recreate a published tag. The workflows reuse an existing GitHub release on reruns so downstream publishing steps can recover.

## Project details

Composer derives this package’s version from Git tags. Do not add a `version` field to `composer.json`. A private frontend `package.json` is build tooling and does not need a package version.

Run `npm run build` after installing the Composer and frontend dependencies. Commit the generated `resources/dist/build` assets and manifest before releasing; consumers install these from the tagged source.

## Maintaining the release tools

When changing the helper, run `python3 scripts/test_release.py`. The tests use temporary repositories and local bare remotes, including a temporary SSH signing key; they never contact GitHub or publish real releases. Keep the helper and its tests consistent across the packages and release-enabled apps.
